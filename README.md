ipy_pep8
========

Simple tool to check PEP8 violations in a IPython notebook and fix them.

The current version of ipy_pep8 has support for nbformats 3 and 4.

Example Usage
=============

Normally I run

    python ipy_pep8.py -f --autopep8 ~/notebooks

to check and fix all notebooks in the ~/notebooks dir.

Ideas
=====

Add interactive editing of flagged code on a chunk basis.
